## Project Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) sentiment analyzer from NLTK. The goal is to extract sentiment scores from customer reviews and analyze how they correlate with the provided star ratings.

## Dataset
**Name:** Amazon Fine Food Reviews  
**Size:** 568,454 reviews  
**Features:**
- Id
- ProductId
- UserId
- ProfileName
- HelpfulnessNumerator
- HelpfulnessDenominator
- Score (1 to 5 stars)
- Time
- Summary
- Text (Review text)  
You can find the dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).

## Methods
### Data Loading and Exploration
- Loaded a subset of 10,000 reviews for efficiency.
- Performed exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of ratings.

### Data Preprocessing
- Checked for and handled missing values.
- No significant preprocessing was needed as VADER works well with raw text.

### Sentiment Analysis with VADER
- Utilized NLTK's VADER sentiment analyzer.
- Calculated negative, neutral, positive, and compound sentiment scores for each review.

### Results Visualization
- Plotted distributions of sentiment scores.
- Analyzed correlations between sentiment scores and star ratings.
- Created heatmaps and boxplots for better insights.
